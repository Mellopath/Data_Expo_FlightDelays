# Data Expo FlightDelays
The 2009 ASA Statistical Computing and Graphics Data Expo consisted of flight arrival and departure  details for all commercial flights on major carriers within the USA, from October 1987 to April 2008. The years I am using is 2000 and 2001. I would be using Python, R and SQLite to query, manipulate and visualize the data. This is a project by University of London.

Questions:
1. When is the best time of day, day of the week, and time of year to fly to minimise delays?
2. Do older planes suffer more delays?
3. How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?
4. Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others?
5. Use the available variables to construct a model that predicts delays.
